# 🎨 **Simple Image Editor** 🖼️

In this project, we will be creating a **Simple Image Editor** that allows users to adjust the image values such as **brightness**, **contrast**, **hue**, **saturation**, **grayscale**, and **sepia**. This image editor will enable users to quickly enhance or modify pictures after they have been captured. All of this will be done **in-browser** using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the **Canvas API**, making the application lightweight and fast.

## 📝 **Prerequisites**:

To follow along with this project, you should have a basic understanding of:

- **HTML** 📄
- **CSS** 🎨
- **JavaScript** 💻
- Basic knowledge of the **Canvas API** 🖌️

You will also need:

- A text editor (e.g., VSCode) ✍️
- A web browser to run the code 🌐

---

## 🚀 **Approach**:

### 1. **HTML Layout**:
The layout defines the structure of the application that will be displayed on the page. It includes several key sections:

- **Header**: Contains the application title and buttons for saving the modified image or resetting the filters.
  
- **Image Preview**: Displays the canvas element, where the image will be previewed while applying different filter values.

- **Filter Sliders**: Provides sliders that will allow users to adjust various image filter values (e.g., brightness, contrast, etc.).

- **Preset Filters**: A set of buttons that allow users to apply predefined filter styles with one click.

- **File Controls Area**: A section with a button that lets users select a new image from their file system.

### 2. **Canvas API**:
We use the **Canvas API** to draw and modify the image directly within the browser. The image will be displayed on the canvas element, and users can interact with it by applying different filters.

### 3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
- **File Selection**: Users can select an image from their device, and the image will be displayed on the canvas.
  
- **Filter Controls**: Sliders will be used to adjust different filters such as brightness, contrast, and hue.

- **Preset Filters**: Users can apply specific styles by clicking preset filter buttons, which will apply predefined values for various image properties.

- **Saving and Resetting**: The application will allow users to save their modified image or reset the filters to their original state.
